class YamlSerializationLegacyFormatTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # This test ensures that legacy YAML data serialized with !map:HashWithIndifferentAccess
  # can be deserialized properly. This format was used in older versions of Rails.
  #
  # CONTEXT: The primary use case is the `extra_fields` column on the `cinstances` table.
  # Extra fields are custom fields defined by FieldsDefinition and stored as a Hash
  # in the extra_fields column (serialized as YAML). The keys are the field names
  # and values are user-provided data.
  #
  # The fix is in config/application.rb where 'HashWithIndifferentAccess' (as a string)
  # is added to yaml_column_permitted_classes.
  #
  # Without this fix, loading old YAML would raise:
  #   Psych::DisallowedClass: Tried to load unspecified class: HashWithIndifferentAccess
