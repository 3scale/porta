  # This method no only moves time to a particular point, it also simulates all scheduled events in the middle.
  # This is useful for testing cases like removing a user, when the user is not really removed until a month later by
  # a job that takes care of it. This kind of behavior can be tested this way:
  #
  # 1. Remove the user
  # 2. time_machine 1 month from now
  # 3. Assert the user has been effectively removed
