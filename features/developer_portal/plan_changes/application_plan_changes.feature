    And all the rolling updates features are off
    And the provider has a default free application plan
    And the provider has a paid application plan
    And a buyer signed up to the provider

  Scenario: Direct plan change
    Given the provider service allows to change application plan directly

    And I want to change the plan of my application to paid
    And I press "Change Plan"
    Then I should see "Plan change was successful."
    And a message should be sent from buyer to provider with plan change details from free to paid

    And I press "Request Plan Change"
    Then I should see "A request to change your application plan has been sent."
    And a message should be sent from buyer to provider requesting to change plan to paid

  Scenario: Change plan workflow dependent on credit card presence

    And I want to change the plan of my application to paid
    And I press "Request Plan Change"
    Then I should see "A request to change your application plan has been sent."

    Given the buyer has a valid credit card with lots of money

    And the provider is charging
    And the provider has testing credentials for braintree

    And I want to change the plan of my application to paid

    And I follow "enter your Credit Card details"

    And Braintree is stubbed to accept credit card for buyer
    And the provider has all the templates setup

    And I follow "enter your Credit Card details"
    Then I should be at url for the braintree credit card details page
    And I follow "Add Credit Card Details and Billing Address"
