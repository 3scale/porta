Feature: Buyer signup
  I want to signup as a buyer
  Background:
    Given a provider exists
    And master has an application plan "enterprise"
    And the provider account allows signups

  Scenario: Signup creates account created event
    And there are no events
    When a buyer signs up
    Then I should see "We have sent you an email to confirm your email address."

    Then there should be 1 valid account created event
      And there should be 1 valid application created event
      And there should be 1 valid service contract created event
      And all the events should be valid
      And the users should receive the application created notification email
      And the users should receive the account created notification email
      And the users should receive the service contract created notification email

  # This is the default behaviour for new providers as of 05-07-2016
  Scenario: Signup forces to fill in credit card for paid plan
    Given the provider is charging its buyers
    And Braintree is stubbed to accept credit card
    And has a buyer with application plan
    And application plan is paid
    And the provider has credit card on signup feature in automatic mode
    And the provider upgrades to plan "enterprise"
    Then the provider should have credit card on signup switch visible
    When the buyer logs in
    Then I should be on the edit credit card details page
    And I should be warned to complete my signup

  # This is the behaviour for existing providers as of 05-07-2016
  Scenario: Signup does not require to fill in credit card on paid plan
    And the provider is charging its buyers

    And has a buyer with application plan
    And application plan is paid
    And the provider has credit card on signup feature in manual mode
    And the provider upgrades to plan "enterprise"
    Then the provider should have credit card on signup switch hidden

    When the buyer logs in
    Then I should be on the homepage

  # This is the behaviour for existing providers as of 05-07-2016
  Scenario: Signup require to fill in credit card on paid plan if switch is enabled

    And application plan is paid
    And the provider has credit card on signup feature in manual mode
    And the provider upgrades to plan "enterprise"
    Then the provider should have credit card on signup switch hidden

    And the provider enables credit card on signup feature manually
