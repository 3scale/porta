Feature: Buyer signup
  I want to signup as a buyer

  Background:
    Given a provider exists
    And the default product of provider "master" has name "Master API"
    And the following application plan:
      | Product    | Name       |
      | Master API | enterprise |
    And the provider account allows signups

  Scenario: Signup creates account created event
    And there are no events
    When a buyer signs up
    Then I should see "We have sent you an email to confirm your email address."

    Then there should be 1 valid account created event
      And there should be 1 valid application created event
      And there should be 1 valid service contract created event
      And all the events should be valid
      And the users should receive the application created notification email
      And the users should receive the account created notification email
      And the users should receive the service contract created notification email

  # This is the default behaviour for new providers as of 05-07-2016
  Scenario: Signup forces to fill in credit card for paid plan
    Given the provider is charging its buyers with braintree
    And the provider has "finance" visible

    And the default product of the provider has name "API"
    And the following application plan:

    And a buyer "Alexander" signed up to application plan "Metal"
    And the provider has credit card on signup feature in automatic mode
    And the provider upgrades to plan "enterprise"
    Then the provider should have credit card on signup switch visible
    When the buyer logs in to the provider
    Then I should be on the edit credit card details page
    And I should be warned to complete my signup
