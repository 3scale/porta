      And provider "planet.express.com" is charging its buyers
      And provider "planet.express.com" has "finance" switch visible
    And the default product of the provider has name "My API"
    And the following application plan:
      | Product | Name   | State     |
      | My API  | Rocket | Published |

  Scenario: I have to pay monthly and setup fee when the trial is over
    Given the date is 23rd November 1989
