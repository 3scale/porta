Feature: Invoice lifecycle
  In order to have be have details about billing process
  As a buyer
  I want to see the whole invoice lifecycle

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" is fake charging
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "finance" switch visible
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has valid payment gateway

      And an application plan "PaidAsInLunch" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost" for 31 monthly
      And the time is 29th May 2009
      And a buyer "alice" signed up to application plan "PaidAsInLunch"
      And I log in as "alice" on foo.3scale.localhost

  @commit-transactions
  Scenario: Normal postpaid life-cycle
    When buyer "alice" has a valid credit card
     And I see my invoice from "May, 2009" is "Pending" on 3rd June 2009
     And I see my invoice from "May, 2009" is "Paid" on 5th June 2009

  @commit-transactions
  Scenario: All charging fails
   Given buyer "alice" has a valid credit card with no money

    When the time flies to 5th June 2009
    Then I see my invoice from "May, 2009" is "Unpaid"

    When the time flies to 8th June 2009
    Then I see my invoice from "May, 2009" is "Unpaid"

    When the time flies to 11th June 2009
    Then I see my invoice from "May, 2009" is "Failed"
