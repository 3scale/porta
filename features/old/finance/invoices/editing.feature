Feature: Edit Invoice
  In order to make invoices work with my accounting
  As a provider
  I Want to edit invoice

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost" with billing enabled
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "finance" switch allowed
      And a buyer "bob" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And an invoice of buyer "bob" for January, 2011
      And an invoice of buyer "bob" for February, 2011

    Given current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And I am logged in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

  Scenario: Edit of invoice billing period fails
    When I am on the invoice "2011-01-00000001" page
     And I follow "Edit"
     And I fill in "Billing Period" with "2011"
     And I press "Update Invoice"
    Then I should see "Billing period format should be YYYY-MM"

  Scenario: Edit of invoice id succeeds but id is not unique
    When I am on the invoice "2011-02-00000001" page
    And I follow "Edit"
    And I fill in "ID" with "2011-01-00000001"
    And I press "Update Invoice"
    Then I should see "This invoice id is already in use"

  Scenario: Eedit of billing period should succeed
    When I am on the invoice "2011-01-00000001" page
     And I follow "Edit"
     And I fill in "Billing Period" with "2011-02"
     And I press "Update Invoice"
    Then I should see "Invoice for February 2011"

  Scenario: Edit of billing period should not raise exception
    When I am on the invoice "2011-01-00000001" page
     And I follow "Edit"
     And I fill in "Billing Period" with "some-invalid-text"
     And I press "Update Invoice"
    Then I should see "Billing period format should be YYYY-MM"
