Feature: Provider lists all invoices
  In order to manage all my invoices
  As a provider
  I want to search, sort and filter all my invoices and only see mine

  Background:
    # TODO: Create invoices directly from background
    Given a provider "xyz.example.com" with billing enabled
      And provider "xyz.example.com" has "finance" switch allowed
    Given a provider "other.example.com" with billing enabled
      And provider "other.example.com" has "finance" switch allowed

    Given an application plan "Fixed" of provider "xyz.example.com" for 200 monthly
      And an application plan "Fixed_for_other" of provider "other.example.com" for 200 monthly
      And the date is 5th October 2010
      And a buyer "foobar" signed up to application plan "Fixed"
      And a buyer "other_buyer" signed up to application plan "Fixed_for_other"
      And time flies to 10th February 2011
      And a buyer "mastermind" signed up to application plan "Fixed"
      And time flies to 20th April 2011
