Feature: Billing with VAT
  In order to allow different VAT rates for buyers
  I want to edit them and see them affecting invoice costs

Background:
  Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost" with billing enabled
    Given provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "finance" switch visible
    And an application plan "best" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost" for 100 monthly

  @commit-transactions
  Scenario: Buyer sees no VAT on an invoice by default
    Given the time is 31st December 2008
    And a buyer "tycoon" signed up to application plan "best"
    And time flies to 3rd February 2009

    When I log in as "tycoon" on "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I navigate to invoice issued for me in "January, 2009"
    Then I should see line items
    | name                         | quantity | cost |
    | Fixed fee ('best')           |          |  100 |
    | Total cost                   |          |  100 |
