  In order to adapt to my changing requirements
  As a buyer
  I want to upgrade or downgrade my plan

  Background:
    Given a provider exists on 1st May 2009
      And the provider is charging its buyers in prepaid mode
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "finance" switch visible
      And all the rolling updates features are on
    And the default product of the provider has name "My API"
    And the following application plans:
      | Product | Name             | Cost per month |

      | My API  | ExpensivePlan    | 0              |
    Given the current domain is foo.3scale.localhost
      And pricing rules on plan "CheapPlan":
      | Metric | Cost per unit | Min | Max      |
      | hits   |             1 |   1 | infinity |
