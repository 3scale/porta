Feature: Log Entries
  In order to know happened with my billing system
  As a provider or master
  I want to see traces of what happened to billing strategy

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" is charging
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "finance" switch visible
    Given an application plan "FreeAsInBeer" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost" for 0 monthly
      And an application plan "PaidAsInLunch" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost" for 31 monthly
      And an application plan "PaidAsInDiplomat" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost" for 3100 monthly
    Given the current domain is "foo.3scale.localhost"

  Scenario: Log Entry is created when invoice is issued
    Given the time is 25th April 2009
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" is charging
      And a buyer "stallman" signed up to application plan "PaidAsInLunch"

    When time flies to 15th May 2009
      And current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    When I log in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    When I go to the log entries page
     And I wait for 3 seconds
    Then I should see the following log entries:
