Feature: Provider accounts authorization
  In order to manage my accounts
  As a provider
  I want to control who can access the accounts area

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has Browser CMS activated
    Given provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has multiple applications enabled
      And a buyer "buyer" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

  Scenario Outline: Provider admin can access accounts
    Given current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    Given provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "groups" switch allowed
    Given provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "multiple_users" switch allowed
    When I log in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

    When I go to the provider dashboard
    #Then show me the page
    Then I should see the link "1 Account" in the audience dashboard widget
    When I follow "1 Account"
    Then I should see the link "Accounts" in the main menu

    When I go to the <page> page
    Then I should be at url for the <page> page

    Examples:
      | page                                 |
      | buyer accounts                       |
      | approved buyer accounts              |
      | pending buyer accounts               |
      | rejected buyer accounts              |
      | new buyer account                    |
      | buyer account "buyer"                |
      | buyer account "buyer" edit           |
      | buyer account "buyer" users          |
      | buyer user "buyer"                   |
      | buyer user "buyer" edit              |
      | buyer account "buyer" invitations    |
      | buyer account "buyer" new invitation |
      | buyer account "buyer" groups         |
