Feature: Provider plans section authorization
  In order to manage my plans
  As a provider
  I want to control who can access the plans area

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.example.com"
      And provider "foo.example.com" has Browser CMS activated
      And provider "foo.example.com" has "account_plans" switch allowed
      And provider "foo.example.com" has "service_plans" visible

      And an account plan "account plan" of provider "foo.example.com"
      And an application plan "app plan" of provider "foo.example.com"
      And a service plan "serv plan" of provider "foo.example.com"

    Given provider "foo.example.com" has "account_plans" switch allowed


  Scenario Outline: Provider admin can access plans
    Given current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.example.com"
     When I log in as provider "foo.example.com"
     When I go to the provider dashboard
     Then I should see "APIs" in the apis dashboard widget
     Then I should see "Products" in the apis dashboard widget
     Then I should see "Backends" in the apis dashboard widget

    When I go to the <page> page
    Then I should be at url for the <page> page
  Examples:
      | page                            |
      | API dashboard                   |

      | application plans admin         |
      | service plans admin             |
