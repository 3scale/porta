  In order to provide various APIs
  As a provider
  I want to have multiple services

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.example.com"
    And a default service of provider "foo.example.com" has name "Fancy API"
    And a service "Second service" of provider "foo.example.com"
    And current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.example.com"

  Scenario: Can create new service setting
    Given I am logged in as provider "foo.example.com"
     And provider "foo.example.com" has "can create service" set to "true"
    When I am on the provider dashboard
    Then I should see "New Product"
    Then I should see "New Backend"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Create new product
    Given I am logged in as provider "foo.example.com"
      And provider "foo.example.com" has "multiple_services" switch allowed
      And service discovery is not enabled
    When I am on the provider dashboard
     And I follow "New Product"
     And I fill in "Name" with "Less fancy API"
     And I press "Create Product"
    Then I should see "Less fancy API"

     And I follow "New Backend"
    #  And I fill in "Name" with "Less fancy Backend"
    #  And I press "Add Backend"
    # Then I should see "Less fancy Backend"

    When I fill in "Name" with "Less fancy API"
     And I press "Update Service"
     And I follow "Integration" within the main menu
     And I follow "Settings"
     And I uncheck "Developers can manage applications"
     And I press "Update Service"
