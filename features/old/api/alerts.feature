Feature: API Usage alerts
  In order to contact my users if they violated usage limits
  As a provider
  I want to see usage alerts and violations

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has multiple applications enabled
      And a application plan "Default" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

    Given a buyer "bob" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And a buyer "alice" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And buyer "bob" has application "Bobget"
      And buyer "alice" has application "Aliget"
      And a metric "foos" with friendly name "Number of Foos" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And a metric "bars" with friendly name "Number of Bars" of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
      And I have following API alerts:
      | Application | Timestamp           | Utilization | Level | Message         | Alert id |
      | Bobget      | 2010-09-13 12:20:00 | 0.5         | 50    | foos: 2 of 4    | 1        |
      | Bobget      | 2010-09-13 15:04:00 | 2           | 200   | bars: 20 of 10  | 5        |
      | Aliget      | 2010-10-14 11:11:00 | 0.9         | 90    | foos: 18 of 20  | 6        |
      | Aliget      | 2010-10-15 14:14:00 | 1.5         | 150   | foos: 30 of 20  | 7        |

    Given current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    Given I am logged in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
