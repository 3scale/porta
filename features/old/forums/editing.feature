Feature: Editing forum topics and posts
  In order to change what I've posted
  As a forum user
  I want to edit or delete my topics and posts

  Background:

    And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "forum" enabled
    And a buyer "buyer" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And a buyer "luser" signed up to provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

    Given provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has the following users:
     | User              | State            |
     | alice             | active           |
     | bob               | active           |

    And the time is 14:00

    And the forum of "foo.3scale.localhost" has the following topics:
     | Topic                  | Owner      | Created at |
     | from buyer today       | buyer      | today      |
     | from buyer yesterday   | buyer      | yesterday  |
