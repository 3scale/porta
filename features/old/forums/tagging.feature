    And plan "Basic" has "Forum" enabled
    And a provider "foo.3scale.localhost" signed up to plan "Basic"

  Scenario: Tagging topic
    And current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I log in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I visit the page to create new topic
    Then I should see the page to create new topic

    When I fill in the obligatory topic fields
    And I fill in "Tags" with "tag1 tag2"
    And I press the topic creation submit button

    Then I should see the newly created topic
    And I should see the tags

    When I log in as "foo.3scale.localhost" on "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I go to "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I visit the forum page with no tag
    Then I should see all the topics on the forum of "foo.3scale.localhost"
