    And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has the swagger example of signup
    And current domain is the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I log in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

  Scenario: Upload Swagger 2.0
    When I go to the new active docs page
    And I fill in the following:

    And I fill in the API JSON Spec with:
    """

        "swagger":"2.0",
        "info":{
            "title":"Product API",

        },
        "paths":{

        }
    }
    """
    And I press "Create Spec"
    Then I should see "ActiveDocs Spec was successfully saved."
    And I should see "Product API"

    When I go to the new active docs page
    And I fill in the following:
      | Name          | UberAPI  |
      | System name   | uberdoze |
