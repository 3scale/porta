Feature: CMS Redirects
  As a provider
  I want to CRUD redirects

  Background:
    Given a provider "foo.3scale.localhost"
    And I am logged in as provider "foo.3scale.localhost" on its admin domain

  Scenario: Full CRUD Cycle on redirects
    When I go to the CMS new redirect page
     And I fill in the following:
       | Source | /from/Shire |
       | Target | /to/Mordor  |
     And I press "Create Redirect"
    Then I should see "Redirect created"

    When I follow "/from/Shire"
      And I fill in "Source" with "/from/Past"
      And I press "Update Redirect"
    Then I should see "Redirect updated"

    When I follow "Delete" and I confirm dialog box
    Then I should see "Redirect deleted"
