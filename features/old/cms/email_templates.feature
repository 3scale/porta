Feature: Email templates management
  In order to have really good CRM
  As a provider

      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has Browser CMS activated
      And provider "foo.3scale.localhost" has "skip_email_engagement_footer" switch visible
    Given I log in as "foo.3scale.localhost" on the admin domain of provider "foo.3scale.localhost"

  Scenario: Creating template
    When I go to the email templates page
    And I follow "Buyer Account approved"
    Then I should see default content of email template "account_approved"

    When I fill in the draft with "new content for account approved"
    And I fill the form with following:
      | Subject | Bcc | Cc | From |
      | subj3ct | dcc | c! | strange@3scale.localhost |
    And I press "Create Email Template"
    Then I should see "Bcc is an invalid email address"
    Then I should see "Cc is an invalid email address"
    Then I should see "From does not match the domain of your outbound email"
    And I fill the form with following:
      | Subject | Bcc            | Cc                            | From       |
      | subj3ct | some@email.com | "Example" <other@3scale.localhost> | My Company |
    And I press "Create Email Template"
    Then I should see "Email Template overrided"
    And the content of the email template "account_approved" should be
      """
      new content for account approved
      """

      | subject | bcc | cc |
      | subj3ct | some@email.com | "Example" <other@3scale.localhost> |
