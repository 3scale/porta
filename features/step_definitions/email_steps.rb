# Commonly used email steps
#
# To add your own steps make a custom_email_steps.rb
# The provided methods are:
#
# last_email_address
# reset_mailer
# open_last_email
# visit_in_email
# unread_emails_for
# mailbox_for
# current_email
# open_email
# read_emails_for
# find_email
#
# General form for email scenarios are:
#   - clear the email queue (done automatically by email_spec)
#   - execute steps that sends an email
#   - check the user received an/no/[0-9] emails
#   - open the email
#   - inspect the email contents
#   - interact with the email (e.g. click links)
#
# The Cucumber steps below are setup in this order.

module EmailHelpers
  def current_email_address
    # Replace with your a way to find your current email. e.g @current_user.email
    # last_email_address will return the last email address used by email spec to find an email.
    # Note that last_email_address will be reset after each Scenario.
    # last_email_address || "example@3scale.localhost"
