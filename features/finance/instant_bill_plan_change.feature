Feature: Instant biling plan change feature
  As a provider I want to charge the variable cost on plan change

  Background:
    Given a provider with billing and finance enabled
    Given the provider service allows to change application plan directly
    And the provider has prepaid billing enabled
    Given all the rolling updates features are off
    And I have instant_bill_plan_change feature enabled
    And the provider has one buyer

  Scenario: Charging variable cost on plan change
    Given the provider has a paid application plan "NoVariable" of 31 per month
    And the provider has another paid application plan "WithVariable" of 310 per month
    And pricing rules on plan "WithVariable":
      | Metric   | Cost per unit | Min    | Max      |
      | hits     |           0.1 |   100 | infinity |

    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "NoVariable"
    And the buyer makes a service transaction with:
      | Metric   | Value  |
      | hits     |    400 |
    When time flies to 3rd January 2017
    And the buyer changed to plan "WithVariable"
    And the buyer makes a service transaction with:
      | Metric   | Value  |
      | hits     |   1000 |
    When time flies to 4th January 2017
    And the buyer changed to plan "NoVariable"
    And the buyer makes a service transaction with:
      | Metric   | Value  |
      | hits     |   5000 |

    When time flies to 6th January 2017
    And the buyer changed to plan "WithVariable"
    And the buyer makes a service transaction with:
      | Metric   | Value  |
      | hits     |   2000 |
    When time flies to 3rd February 2017

    Then the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" in the 1st invoice:
      | name                                                    | quantity |  cost     |
      | Fixed fee ('NoVariable')                                |          |     31.00 |
      | Total cost                                              |          |     31.00 |

    # Upgrading can be done
    # Not charging NoVariable variable cost (there is none)
    And the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" in the 2nd invoice:
      | name                                                    | quantity |  cost     |
      | Refund ('NoVariable')                                   |          |    -29.00 |
      | Application upgrade ('NoVariable' to 'WithVariable')    |          |    290.00 |
      | Total cost                                              |          |    261.00 |

    # FIXME: Downgrading will not refund as it will `result` in negative invoice for fixed fee
    # but actually the total (fixed + variable) > 0
    # This is a case we need to solve with negative invoices

    And the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" in the 3rd invoice:
      | name                                                    | quantity |  cost     |

      | Total cost                                              |          |     90.10 |

    And the buyer should have following line items for "February, 2017" invoice:
      | name                                                    | quantity |  cost     |
      | Fixed fee ('WithVariable')                              |          |    310.00 |
      | Hits                                                    |     2000 |    190.10 |
      | Total cost                                              |          |    500.10 |
