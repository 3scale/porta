Feature: Automatic billing with plan changes on POSTPAID
  As a provider I want to differentiate costs added by the automatic
  billing job and my manually created invoices

  Background:
    Given a provider
    And the provider is charging its buyers in postpaid mode
    And the provider has "finance" visible
    Given the provider service allows to change application plan directly
    And the provider has one buyer on 1st January 2017
    And the provider has a paid application plan "Paid" of 31 per month
    And the provider has another paid application plan "Expensive" of 3100 per month

  Scenario: Monthly fee on application plan upgrading the same day
    Given all the rolling updates features are off
    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Paid"
    Then the buyer changed to plan "Expensive"
    When time flies to 3rd February 2017

    Then the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" invoice:
      | name                        | quantity |  cost     |
      | Fixed fee ('Paid')          |          |    31.00  |
      | Refund ('Paid')             |          |   -31.00  |
      | Fixed fee ('Expensive')     |          | 3,100.00  |
      | Total cost                  |          | 3,100.00  |

  Scenario: Monthly fee on application plan downgrading the same day
    Given all the rolling updates features are off
    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Expensive"
    Then the buyer changed to plan "Paid"
    When time flies to 3rd February 2017

    Then the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" invoice:
      | name                        | quantity |   cost    |
      | Fixed fee ('Expensive')     |          |  3,100.00 |
      | Refund ('Expensive')        |          | -3,100.00 |
      | Fixed fee ('Paid')          |          |     31.00 |
      | Total cost                  |          |     31.00 |

  Scenario: Monthly fee on application plan downgrading in the middle of the same day
    Given all the rolling updates features are off
    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Expensive"
    And the date is 1st January 2017 12:00
    Then the buyer changed to plan "Paid"
    When time flies to 3rd February 2017

    Then the buyer should have following line items for "January, 2017" invoice:
      | name                        | quantity |   cost    |
      | Fixed fee ('Expensive')     |          |  3,100.00 |
      | Refund ('Expensive')        |          | -3,050.00 |
      | Fixed fee ('Paid')          |          |     30.50 |
      | Total cost                  |          |     80.50 |

  Scenario: Monthly fee on application plan downgrading on different day
    Given all the rolling updates features are off
    And the date is 1st January 2017 UTC
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Expensive"
    And time flies to 2nd January 2017
    Then the buyer changed to plan "Paid"
    When time flies to 3rd February 2017

      | Fixed fee ('Paid')          |          |     30.00 |
      | Total cost                  |          |    130.00 |
    And there is only one invoice for "January, 2017"

    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Paid"
    And time flies to 2nd January 2017

    And the date is 1st January 2017
    And the buyer signed up for plan "Paid"
    And time flies to 2nd January 2017
    Then I create a new invoice from the API for this buyer for January, 2017 with:
