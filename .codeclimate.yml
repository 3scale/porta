# This is a sample .codeclimate.yml configured for Engine analysis on Code
# Climate Platform. For an overview of the Code Climate Platform, see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/300-the-codeclimate-platform

# Under the engines key, you can configure which engines will analyze your repo.
# Each key is an engine name. For each value, you need to specify enabled: true
# to enable the engine as well as any other engines-specific configuration.

# For more details, see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/289-configuring-your-repository-via-codeclimate-yml#platform

# For a list of all available engines, see here:

# Engines can analyze files and report issues on them, but you can separately
# decide which files will receive ratings based on those issues. This is
# specified by path patterns under the ratings key.

# For more details see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/289-configuring-your-repository-via-codeclimate-yml#platform

# Note: If the ratings key is not specified, this will result in a 0.0 GPA on your dashboard.
