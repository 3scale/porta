# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          Location of your OpenID Provider. The format of this endpoint is determined on your OpenID Provider setup. A common guidance would be "https://&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt;:&lt;CLIENT_SECRET&gt;@&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/auth/realms/&lt;REALM_NAME&gt;".
        hostname_rewrite: |
          Lets you define a custom <code>Host</code> request header. This is needed if your API backend only accepts traffic from a specific host.
        secret_token: |
          Enables you to block any direct developer requests to your API backend; each 3scale API gateway call to your API backend contains a request header called <code>X-3scale-proxy-secret-token</code>.
          The value of this header can be set by you here. It's up to you ensure your backend only allows calls with this secret header.
        jwt_claim_with_client_id_type: |
          Process the ClientID Token Claim value as a string or as a liquid template. When set to 'Liquid' you can define more complex rules. e.g. If 'some_claim' is an array you can select the first value this like {{ some_claim | first }}.
        jwt_claim_with_client_id: |
          The Token Claim that contains the clientID. Defaults to 'azp'.
