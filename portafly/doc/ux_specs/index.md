# PortaFly UX/UI specifications
This documentation collects all UX/UI specifications as part of the Design deliverables for the PortaFly project.

Please refer to the single page files together with mockups linked in each page file for a complete mapping of each screen's UI and states (validation errors, expanded menus etc).
