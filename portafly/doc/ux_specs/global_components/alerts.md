### Input field validation errors / alerts
* This type of alerts will be displayed as **inline alerts**
* Validation errors – they block the form from being submitted successfully:
  * Variant prop is `danger`
* Validation alerts with high severity – they still allow the form to be submitted:
  * Variant prop is `warning`
