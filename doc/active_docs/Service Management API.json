It can be optionally used to authenticate a call using an application key. It's possible to pass a 'predicted usage' to the authorize call. This can serve three purposes:\n1) To make sure an API call won't go over the limits before the call is made, if the usage of the call is known in advance. In this case, the estimated usage can be passed to the authorize call, and it will respond whether the actual API call is still within limit.\n2) To limit the authorization only to a subset of metrics. If usage is passed in, only the metrics listed in it will be checked against the limits. For example: There are two metrics defined: _searches_ and _updates_. _updates_ are already over limit, but _searches_ are not. In this case, the user should still be allowed to do a search call, but not an update one.\n3) If no usage is passed then any metric with a limit exceeded state will result in an _authorization_failed_ response.\n\n**Note:** Even if the predicted usage is passed in, authorize is still a **read-only** operation. You have to make the report call to report the usage.\n\nThe response can have an HTTP response code: `200` OK (if authorization is granted), `409` (if it's not granted, typically application over limits or keys missing, check 'reason' tag), `403` (for authentication errors, check 'error' tag) and `404` (not found).",

Transactions are processed asynchronously by the 3scale's backend.\n\nTransactions from a single batch are reported only if all of them are valid. If there is an error in processing of at least one of them, none is reported.\n\nNote that a batch can only report transactions to the same service, `service_id` is at the same level as `service_token`. Multiple report calls will have to be issued to report transactions to different services.\n\nBe aware that reporting metrics that are limited at the time of reporting will have no effect.\n\nSupported Content-Type values for this POST call are: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.",
