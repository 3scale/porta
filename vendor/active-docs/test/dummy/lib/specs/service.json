It is used to check if a particular application exists, is active and is within its usage limits. It can be optionally used to authenticate a call using an application key. It's possible to pass a 'predicted usage' to the authorize call. This can serve two purposes: 1) To make sure an API call won't go over the limits before the call is made, if the usage of the call is known in advance. In this case, the estimated usage can be passed to the authorize call, and it will respond whether the actual API call is still within limit. And, 2) To limit the authorization only to a subset of metrics. If usage is passed in, only the metrics listed in it will be checked against the limits. For example: There are two metrics defined: searches and updates. updates are already over limit, but searches are not. In this case, the user should still be allowed to do a search call, but not an update one. Note: Even if the predicted usage is passed in, authorize is still a read-only operation. You have to make the report call to report the usage.
