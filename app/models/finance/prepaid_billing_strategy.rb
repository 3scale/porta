  # Billing plan change on prepaid cases:
  # 2) This behaviour was already there.
  #
  # 1) If the contract has never been invoiced:
  # Meaning the plan change is happening the same day as the creation of the contract
  # We can refund safely and we will have proper line items in the same invoice:
  #
  # Description             | Cost
  # ----------------------- | -----
  # Setup fee Plan A        |   200
  # Refund Plan A           |  -200
  # Upgrade Plan A to Plan B|   100
  # Total                   |   100
  #
  # 2) If the contract has already been invoiced:
  # Meaning the plan change is happening another day than the creation of the contract.
  # Billing has run already (paid_until is already set) and an invoice was issued.
  # We cannot refund safely as we would end up with the second invoice having negative total on downgrade.
  # So what we do is only add a line item if it is an upgrade and not a downgrade of plan.
  #
  # We will have two invoices issued on different dates (it is prepaid):
  #
  #
  # Description             | Cost
  # ----------------------- | -----
  # Setup fee Plan A        |   200
  # Total                   |   200

  #
  # Description             | Cost
  # ----------------------- | -----
