# Represents a recipient on a message.  The kind of recipient (to, cc, or bcc) is
# determined by the +kind+ attribute.
#
# == States
#
# Recipients can be in 1 of 2 states:
# * +unread+ - The message has been sent, but not yet read by the recipient.  This is the *initial* state.
# * +read+ - The message has been read by the recipient
#
# == Interacting with the message
#
# In order to perform actions on the message, such as viewing, you should always
# use the associated event action:
# * +view!+ - Marks the message as read by the recipient
#
# == Hiding messages
#
# Although you can delete a recipient, it will also delete it from everyone else's
# message, meaning that no one will know that person was ever a recipient of the
# message.  Instead, you can hide messages from users with the following actions:
# * +hide!+ -Hides the message from the recipient's inbox
# * +unhide!+ - Makes the message visible again
