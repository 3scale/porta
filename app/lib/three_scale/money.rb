module ThreeScale

  # This class represents some amount of money with currency. It behaves more or
  #   less like Numeric type, so it supports basic arithemtic operations,
  #   comparisons, and so on. All operators convert both money objects to the
  #   same currency (the currency of the first operand) before performing
  #   calculations. The conversion is done using exchange rates that are fetched
  #   from external service. A money object can also have a date specified,
  #   which is then used by currency conversion to use historic rates from that
  #   date.
