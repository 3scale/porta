# frozen_string_literal: true

# This module encapsulates behaviour needed for Buyer, to change its
# Plan with respect to the permissions set on the judging object
# (Service for ApplicationPlans, Provider for AccountPlan and
# ServicePlan)
#
# Both Provider and Service should quack like an 'Issuer', that is
# respond to:
#
#  +plan_change_permission(plan_type, :new_contract => true/false)+ - returns one of Logic::PlanChanges::PERMISSIONS
#
# On Contract, the important methods are:
#
# +can_change_plan?+ - returns true if any form of change is possible
# +buyer_changes_plan+ - triggers the change (or request to change) of a plan
# +plan_change_permission_name+ - returns name of the allowed action
# +plan_change_permission_warning+ - returns warning message of the allowed action
#
