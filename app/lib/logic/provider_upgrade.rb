        #
        # We used to have all switches hardcoded in this file, above. They used to be all as Strings, and this method was implemented 6 years ago
        # (see https://github.com/3scale/system/commit/d7a447c41854fcd69ddb91fb36cbb053a6fb23a3#diff-feacd82d9caaddafd3ed1da2edb64f26R66)
        # searching an String in an array of Strings.
        #
        # In another PR, 2 years ago, those switches hardcoded became Symbols
        # (see https://github.com/3scale/system/commit/53a1965159734a4eaf2cf732e6bf35894ab5b8ea)
        # but this method didn't change, and was doing `settings.switches.select { |name, switch| array_of_symbols.exclude?(name.to_s) && switch.hideable? }`,
        # (see https://github.com/3scale/system/blob/43d09fe07824fea37ef6dfb9ee3b1eeac0abb27a/app/lib/logic/provider_upgrade.rb#L131),
        # so the whole method was functioning like if the code was just `settings.switches.select { |_name, switch| switch.hideable? }`.
        # Probably this was not the intention.
        #
        # There used to be a test but it was stubbing this constant with a content of a String that is not what it actually contains
        # (see https://github.com/3scale/system/blob/43d09fe07824fea37ef6dfb9ee3b1eeac0abb27a/test/unit/logic/provider_upgrade_test.rb#L28)
        #
        # In https://github.com/3scale/system/pull/9326, this method changes to `settings.switches.select { |_name, switch| switch.hideable? }`,
        # intending to fix this problem in the next PR.
