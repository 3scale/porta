Hello support team!

New Path <%= @base_path %> has been added to ActiveDocs (<%= @service.id %>)
for provider <%= @account.external_domain %> (<%= @account.id %>).
If you want to contact the provider, please do <%= @reply_to %>.

No action is required, if the basePath looks very fishy
(for instance: no domain name but only ip, pointing to
a domain that clearly does not belong to: api.facebook.com, twitter.com, etc.)
please report it to the TechTeam.

Your system.
