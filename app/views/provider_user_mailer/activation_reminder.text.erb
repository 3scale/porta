A couple of days ago you signed up for Red Hat 3scale to manage your API.
Now would be as good a time as any to activate your account:

<%= @activate_url %>

You will then be able to login with your email and password. If you have problems activating your account please contact customer service (https://access.redhat.com/customerservice).
