h1 Application Plans
p
  | Application plans establish the rules (limits, pricing, features) for
  | using your API; every developer's application accessing your API
  | will be accessing it within the constraints of an application plan.
  | From a business perspective, application plans allow you to target different
  | audiences by using multiple plans, that is, basic, pro, premium,
  | with different sets of rules.
