<h1>Application Plans</h1>

<p class="description">
  Application Plans establish the rules (limits, pricing, features) for
  using your API; every developer's application accessing your API will be accessing it within the
  constraints of an Application Plan. From a business perspective, Application Plans allow you
  to target different audiences by using multiple plans (i.e. 'basic', 'pro', 'premium') with
  different sets of rules.
