        1. You can highlight elements by assigning a `data-quickstart-id` attribute. 
          
          **Example**

          ```data-quickstart-id="context-selector"```
        1. From within the quick start, you can trigger that by by writing markdown such as:
          
          **Example**

          ``
          Highlight the [context selector] {{highlight context-selector}}
          ``

          - Highlight the [context selector]{{highlight context-selector}}
