    Learn how to create a mapping rule with a method to track API usage.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will learn about how to create a mapping rule with a method to track API usage. To learn more, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html-single/administering_the_api_gateway/index#how-apicast-applies-mapping-rules-for-capturing-usage-of-threescale-apis_api-gateway-apicast).
  tasks:
    - title: Create a method
      description: |-
        Create a method for your API  product.To learn about what a method is, see: Methods.

        ### Prerequisites

        - A product. To learn how to create a product, see: creating-an-api-product.
        - An application plan. To learn how to create an application plan, see: creating-access-tiers-for-api-consumers.

        ### Procedure

        1. Go to <strong>[Your_product_name] > Overview</strong> page: click the menu on the header, select <strong>Products</strong> and click <strong>[You_ product_name]</strong>.
        1. On <strong>[Your_product_name] > Overview</strong> page, click <strong>Integration > Methods & Metrics</strong> on the side menu.
        1. Click <strong>Add a method</strong>.
        1. On the <strong>New method</strong> page, fill in the details:
              - _Friendly name_: Give a name to the method. The friendly name must be unique for the product, for example, _Flight API Call_.
              - _System name_: GThis is the name for 3scale to identify the method. The system name must be unique. The name can be similar to the product, for example, _Flight_API_call_.
              - Description: Add optional details about your method.
        1. Click <strong>Create method</strong>.

        If the process is successful, you will see <strong>[Your_product_name] > Methods & metrics</strong> page.

        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
    - title: Add mapping rule to a method
      description: |-
        Add mapping rules to a method, which enables setting usage limits and pricing rules in the product’s application plan. To learn about what a mapping rule is, see: learning-about-mapping-rules.

        ### Procedure

        1. On <strong>[Your_product_name] > Overview</strong> page, click <strong>Integration > Mapping rules</strong> on the side menu.
        1. Click <strong>Create mapping</strong> rule
        1. On the <strong>New mapping rule<strong> page, fill in the details:
              - _Verb_: Select the HTTP request verb, for example, select _GET_, _POST_, _DELETE_, or _PUT_.
              - _Pattern_: This is the pattern to map a request with metric or method. Add a valid path that starts with a forward slash `/`. The URL can be from a wildcard you have specified inside curly brackets `{}`. For example, if you create a method _Flight API Call_,you can create a pattern `/Flight-API-Call/{distric`}/name`.
              - _Method or metric to increment_: Select from one of your previously created methods. For example, select _Flight API Call_.
              - _Increment by_: Add the counter increment number, For example, _1_.
              - _Last?_: Check it if this mapping rule should be considered as the last one to stop processing other mapping rules.
              - _Position_: This is for 3scale to sort the mapping rule. Set the position of the execution of the mapping rule, for example, _1_.
          1. Click <strong>Create mapping rule</strong>:

        If the process is successful, you will see <strong>[Your_product_name] > Mapping rules</strong> page.
