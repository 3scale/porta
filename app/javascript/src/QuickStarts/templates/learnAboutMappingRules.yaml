  # 1. Find an .svg you want to use, like from here: https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/icons/#all-icons
  # 2. Upload the file here and encode it (output format - plain text): https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
  # 3. compose - `icon: data:image/svg+xml;base64,<base64 string from step 2>`
  # - If empty string (icon: ''), will use a default rocket icon
  # - If set to null (icon: ~) will not show an icon

    Learn about capturing usage of API endpoints or API packages.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will learn about methods. To learn more, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html-single/admin_portal_guide/index#adding-mapping-rules-to-methods-and-metrics_methods-and-metrics-for-products-and-backends).

    - title:  Learn about mapping rules
      description: |-

        Mapping rules specify details about the usage data that you want to capture of method or metrics. With mapping rules, you can decide which API or API packages you want to assign to which method or metric and check the counting in the analytics section.

        Adding mapping rules to a method enables setting usage limits and pricing rules in each product’s application plan and an individual API endpoint connects to that API package.
