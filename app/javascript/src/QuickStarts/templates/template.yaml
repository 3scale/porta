    Create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale.
  introduction: |-
    This quick start guides you to create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale as an API provider including 7 tasks. To learn more about API configuration, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.11/html/getting_started/first-steps-with-threescale_configuring-your-api#products-backends-for-threescale-apis_configuring-your-api).
  tasks:
    - title: Create a new backend
      description: |-
        ## Text

        1. The main body of the task. You can use markdown syntax here to create list items and more.

          This is a paragraph.  
          This is another paragraph. Add an empty line between paragraphs for line breaks or two spaces at the end.
        1. For more information on markdown syntax you can visit [this resource](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
        1. A <small>limited set</small> of <strong>HTML tags</strong> [are also supported](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/web_console/creating-quick-start-tutorials.html#supported-tags-for-quick-starts_creating-quick-start-tutorials)
        
        ## Highlighting

        To enable highlighting, the markdown syntax should contain:
        - Bracketed link text
        - The highlight keyword, followed by the ID of the element that you want to animate
        - The element to be highlighted, needs a `data-quickstart-id` attribute

        **Example**
        <pre>
        [Quick starts nav item]{{highlight context-selector}}
        </pre>
        will highlight an element with the `data-quickstart-id="context-selector"` attribute
        
        ### Code snippets

        The syntax for an inline code snippet contains:
        - Text between back quotes, followed by `{{copy}}`

        The following text demonstates an inline-copy element `https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git`{{copy}}

        The syntax for multi-line code snippets:
        - Text between triple back quotes, followed by `{{copy}}`

        ```
        oc new-app ruby~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git
        echo "Expose route using oc expose svc/ruby-ex"
        oc expose svc/ruby-ex
        ```{{copy}}
