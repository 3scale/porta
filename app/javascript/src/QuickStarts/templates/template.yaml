    Create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale.
  introduction: |-
    This quick start guides you to create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale as an API provider including 7 tasks. To learn more about API configuration, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.11/html/getting_started/first-steps-with-threescale_configuring-your-api#products-backends-for-threescale-apis_configuring-your-api).
  tasks:
    - title: Create a new backend
      description: |-
        A backend is an internal API that is bundled to a product. In this quick start, you first create a backend and then a product.In practice, you can create either product or backend first.

        ### Note
        Important fields:
        - _System name_:  3scale needs this name to internally identify and refer to the backend.
        - _Private Base URL_: It is the base URL endpoint of the private API.
        
        ### Procedure

        1. Go to Backends page: click the context selector on the header and select <strong>Backends</strong>.
        1. On the Backend page, click <strong>Create backend</strong>.
        1. On the _New backend_ page, fill in the details to create the backend.
        1. Click <strong>Create backend</strong>.
