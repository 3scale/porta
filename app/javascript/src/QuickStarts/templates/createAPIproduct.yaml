    Create an API product with 3scale.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will learn about how to create an API package for managing, exposing, or monitoring your API. To learn more, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html/getting_started/first-steps-with-threescale_configuring-your-api#creating-products-test-api-calls_configuring-your-api).

    - title: Create a backend
      description: |-
        Create a backend. To learn what a backend is, see: Backends

        ### Procedure

        1. Go to the <strong>Backends</strong> page: click the menu on the header and select <strong>Backends</strong>.
        1. On the <strong>Backends</strong> page, click <strong>Create backend</strong>.

              - _System name_: This is the name for 3scale to identify the backend, for example, _Flight_API_.
              - _Description_: Add optional details about your backend.
              - _Private Base URL_: The URL endpoint of your backend, for example, _http://flight.api.com_.
        1. Click <strong>Create backend</strong>

        If the process is successful, you will see <strong>[Your\_backend] > Overview</strong> page.

    - title: Connect the backend with the product
      description: |-
        Connect the backend with a product. You must associate at least one backend with the product before exposing it to the API consumers.

        ### Procedure

        1. On <strong>[Your\_product\_name]</strong> overview page, click <strong>Integration > Backends</strong> on the side menu.
        1. Click <strong>Add backend</strong>.
        1. On the _Add a backend_ page, fill in the details:
                - _Backend_: Select the backend you want to connect to the product, for example, _Flight API_.
                - _Path_: Path is an optional route related to a product from which you can access a particular backend. For example, if your backend is http:// flight api.com, set the path as Flight. Your product will access the backend through http://flight api.com/path. You can give the same backend the same path in different products.
        1. Click <strong>Add to product</strong>

        If the connection is successful, you will see <strong>[Your\_product\_backend] > Overview page</strong>. The path will follow port:80, which is automatically generated. You can change to a port of your choice.
