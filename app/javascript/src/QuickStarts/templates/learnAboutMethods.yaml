  # - The icon defined as a base64 value. Example flow:
  # 1. Find an .svg you want to use, like from here: https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/icons/#all-icons
  # 2. Upload the file here and encode it (output format - plain text): https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
  # 3. compose - `icon: data:image/svg+xml;base64,<base64 string from step 2>`
  # - If empty string (icon: ''), will use a default rocket icon
  # - If set to null (icon: ~) will not show an icon

    Learn about tracking the number of API calls.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will learn about methods. To learn more, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html-single/admin_portal_guide/index#designating-methods-and-adding-metrics-for-capturing-usage-details_methods-and-metrics-for-products-and-backends).
  tasks:
    - title:  Learn about methods
      description: |-

        You can use methods to track API usage, capture the number of individual API calls of your API packages, or API endpoints. Hits is the native metric that exists for each API to track the number of API calls. Reporting traffic to a method automatically increases counters. **Method** is a way to group hits depending on the mapping rules created. Then you can define usage limits and pricing rules for individual methods within each application plan.
