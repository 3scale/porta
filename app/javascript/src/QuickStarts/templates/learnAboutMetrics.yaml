  # - The icon defined as a base64 value. Example flow:
  # 1. Find an .svg you want to use, like from here: https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/icons/#all-icons
  # 2. Upload the file here and encode it (output format - plain text): https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
  # 3. compose - `icon: data:image/svg+xml;base64,<base64 string from step 2>`
  # - If empty string (icon: ''), will use a default rocket icon
  # - If set to null (icon: ~) will not show an icon

    Learn how to track the API usage with metrics.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will learn about metrics. To learn more, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html-single/admin_portal_guide/index#designating-methods-and-adding-metrics-for-capturing-usage-details_methods-and-metrics-for-products-and-backends).

    - title:  Learn about metrics
      description: |-

        Metrics track API usage other than API calls of your API packages or endpoints. To capture usage of your API apart from hits, define a metric that reports the usage in different units. A unit should be quantifiable and apply a meaning for your business goals, such as megabytes, CPU time, or the number of elements returned by the API.
        ![Metrics with units "megabytes" or "CPU" may belong to either a Product or a Backend.](/assets/quickstarts/learn-about-metrics.png "Learn about tracking the number of API calls.")
