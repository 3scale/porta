    Create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale.
  introduction: |-
    This quick start guides you to create the required objects to complete a basic integration with 3scale as an API provider including 7 tasks. 
    
    To learn more about API configuration, see the [3scale documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.11/html/getting_started/first-steps-with-threescale_configuring-your-api#products-backends-for-threescale-apis_configuring-your-api).
  tasks:
    - title: Create a new backend
      description: |-
        A backend is an internal API that is bundled to a product. In this quick start, you first create a backend and then a product.In practice, you can create either product or backend first.
        
        ### Procedure

        1. Go to _Backends_ page: click the context selector on the header and select <strong>Backends</strong>.
        1. On the _Backends_ page, click <strong>Create backend</strong>.
        1. On the _New backend_ page, fill in the details to create the backend. 
        
          Important fields:
              - _System name_:  3scale needs this name to internally identify and refer to the backend.
              - _Private Base URL_: It is the base URL endpoint of the private API.
        1. Click <strong>Create backend</strong>

                - You can indicate / as the path of one of the backends.
                - Paths must be unique inside the product.
                - You can give the same backend the same path in different products.

    - title: Promote configuration to staging
      description: |-
        Before you can send a test request to your API product, you must promote the APIcast configuration to staging and production. An APIcast configuration consists of the backends you have added to a product with the corresponding mapping rules, applications, and application plans.

        ### Procedure

        1. Go to <strong>[Your\_product\_name] > Integration > Configuration</strong> page.
              - Click the context selector on the header and select _Product_.
              - Click <strong>[Your\_product\_name]</strong> and go to the _Overview_ page.
              - Click <strong>Integration > Configuration</strong>  on left navigation.
        1. Under _APIcast Configuration_, click <strong>Promote v.[n] to Staging APIcast</strong>.
        1. Under Staging APIcast, click <strong>Promote v.[n] to Production APIcast</strong>.

        > <strong>Tip:</strong> Every time you modify the product configuration and before making calls to your API, you must promote the updated configuration to the staging and production environments.

    - title: Test example curl
      description: |-
        After promoting the API cast configuration, you can send a command line request to a product to test the integration of a backend based on the first mapping rule added to the product.

        ### Procedure

        - To test requests to your API product, copy the command provided in Example curl for testing and run it in a terminal.
        - The curl command example is based on the first mapping rule of the product.
        - After you run the command, you should get an HTML response containing results from the backend you are testing.
        - If you do not get a response, delete the catch-all mapping rule from your product, promote the new APIcast configuration to staging and then to production, and run the example curl command.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Did you create an application plan for your product?
          - Did you create an application that subscribes to the application plan?
          - Did you promote the APIcast configuration to staging and production?
        failedTaskHelp: This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
