    introduction: `Red Hat® OpenShift® Serverless lets you run stateless, serverless workloads on a single multi-cloud container platform.

Serverless reduces the need to manage infrastructure or perform back-end development. Scaling is automated, and applications can run on any cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environment. Choosing Serverless means simplicity, portability, and efficiency.

Adding OpenShift Serverless to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster is quick and easy. This quick start walks you through the process.`,
